    "The benefits of git include\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed** which sets apart git from other VCS such as Subversion. Allows for a central repository that can sync with multiple hosts\n",
    "- **Branching** which allows the compartmentalization of work by features or tiny meaningful chunks\n",
    "- **Merging** which allows for verification and resolution of software conflicts and issues\n",
    "- **Changelog** which allows users to replay and even revert previous changes.\n",
    "- **Free and open source** cause free things are always cool. Also if something is wrong, you can fix it or raise an issue\n",

    "GitHub is an **online repository** that allows you to share code with others. There are enterprise versions which essentially means that companies host their own servers (or host private repositories) with GitHub installed and the relevant security measures in place. There is also an open source version managed by the GitHub team that is available for everyone. Think of github as kind of like a dropbox or cloud storage built to display git changes via browser.\n",

    "- It is suggested that branch names are relevant to the work you are doing\n",

    "A typical git workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new feature branch\n",
    "2. Make commits to save your work\n",
    "3. Review changes made compared to master\n",
    "4. Push changes to master\n",
    "5. Repeat as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "In between those steps, you may have to perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pull in new changes made to master (via other people's merges)\n",
    "2. Resolve merge conflicts\n",
    "    - This means a change was committed for a file that you are also changing\n",
    "3. Realize git erased files and start losing your mind\n",
    "    - Don't worry there is usually a way to revert this, so you can always ask me!\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also have branches of branches which are typically used when the master branch is a stable baseline for the code and a versioning branch is used for updates and changes. Feature branches are then branched off of that. It is rare for branching to go further than this level and highly unadvisable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking repositories is also a thing that people may do. Forking creates a clone of a remote git repository and changes are not synced between the forked repository and the main repository unless they are merged. This is usually not performed unless you want to take someone else's code and refactor it significantly.\n",
